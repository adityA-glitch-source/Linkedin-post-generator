It\u2019s about a broken system where 60% of applicants never hear back. \n Your mental health is not worth sacrificing for a system that doesn\u2019t acknowledge your worth. \n Please remember, taking care of yourself is the real priority. \n Your dream job will come, but for now, breathe. \ud83c\udf3b",
