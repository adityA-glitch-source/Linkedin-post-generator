It\u2019s about a broken system where 60% of applicants never hear back. \n Your mental health is not worth sacrificing for a system that doesn\u2019t acknowledge your worth. \n Please remember, taking care of yourself is the real priority. \n Your dream job will come, but for now, breathe. \ud83c\udf3b",

It hurt deeply. But now, when things don\u2019t go as planned, I don\u2019t panic.\n\nI don\u2019t question my worth. I sit back, breathe, and trust. The Universe knows.\n\nI know there's another plan waiting.
